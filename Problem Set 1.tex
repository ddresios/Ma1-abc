\begin{enumerate}

\item
Prove that $x + \frac 1x \geq 2$ for all $x > 0$ and use this result to show that $\frac{a+b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab}$ for all $a, b > 0$.

\item
Prove that $\sqrt{10}$ is irrational and deduce that $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{5}$ is also irrational.

\item
Prove, by induction or otherwise, that $\sum_{k=1}^n k^3 = \left(\sum_{k=1}^n k\right)^2$.

\item
Each card in a pack has a number on one side and a letter on the other. Four cards are
placed on the table:
\[ \boxed{2} \; \boxed{3} \; \boxed{A} \; \boxed{B}\]
You are permitted to turn just two cards in order to test the following hypothesis: a card that
has an even number on one side has a vowel on the other. Which two cards should you turn and why? 

\item
Which of the following relations on $\mathbb{N}$ are reflexive, which are symmetric and which are transitive:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $a \mid b$ (`$a$ divides $b$'),
\item[(ii)] $a \nmid b$ (`$a$ does not divide $b$'),
\item[(iii)] $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder after division by $2025$,
\item[(iv)] gcd$(a, b) > 2025$?
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
